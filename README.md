# Powerball-Predictor
Note: it is impossible to predict Lottery numbers! This project is just for fun.  
A collection of code analysing and attempting to predict the Australian Powerball lottery using tensorflow, including:  

LottoSite_Scraper - Scrape Australian historical Lottery data
Powerball results%.csv - Previous powerball results  
Lotto_Historical_Freq1 - Calculates pattern frequnecy of Powerball numbers  
Lotto_Historical_Freq_distance2 - Calculate the average distance between sorted numbers in a draw  
Lotto_Historical_draft2 - (incomplete) Expanded version with different analysis options (have removed some), Number frequency analysis matches reported online lotto statistics  

Tensorflow2_legacy - Origional ChatGPT code to use neural network model to "predict" (very unpredictable and random) lottery numbers  
Tensorflow3 - Neural network model to "predict" (very unpredictable and random) lottery numbers  
Tensorflow4 - More advanced version of Tensorflow3 and more training  

RandomDraw_%.java - same files from Powerball-Number-Generator to generate random lotto numbers
