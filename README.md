Lotto_Historical_draft2 - Expanded version with different analysis options (have removed some), Number frequency analysis matches reported online lotto statistics  

Tensorflow2_legacy - Origional ChatGPT code to use neural network model to "predict" (very unpredictable and random) lottery numbers  
Tensorflow3 - Neural network model to "predict" (very unpredictable and random) lottery numbers  
Tensorflow4 - More advanced version of Tensorflow3 and more training
